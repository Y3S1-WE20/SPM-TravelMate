   - `isOwnReview = review.userId._id === user._id`
2. **Confirmation Dialogs:**
   - Prevent accidental deletions
   - `window.confirm()` before delete
3. **Form Validation:**
   - Required fields enforced
   - Rating within valid range (1-5)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "You can only review properties you have booked"
**Cause:** User hasn't booked the property or booking status isn't confirmed/completed
**Solution:** 
1. Verify booking exists in database
2. Check booking status field
3. Ensure userId and propertyId match

### Issue 2: Edit/Delete buttons not appearing
**Cause:** User ID mismatch between review owner and logged-in user
**Solution:**
1. Check `review.userId._id === user._id` logic
2. Ensure reviews are populated with userId
3. Verify user authentication

### Issue 3: Review not updating after edit
**Cause:** State not properly updating in React
**Solution:**
1. Check `setReviews()` callback in submitReview
2. Ensure API returns updated review
3. Verify review._id matching logic

### Issue 4: Stats not recalculating
**Cause:** fetchReviewStats() not called after changes
**Solution:**
1. Add `fetchReviewStats()` after create/update/delete
2. Ensure endpoint is working: GET /api/reviews/stats/:propertyId
